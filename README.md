### Problem Statement:
- Zero Waste Hunger Management
  - How NGO's can leverage AI Just in Australia, 7.3 million tones of food is lost or wasted, estimated to be 298 kg per capita per year. 
  - At the same time, over 5 million Australians experience food insecurity each year. Traditionally NGOs are not equipped or funded to use the latest AI Data Driven Technology
    to help provide these services efficiently with the best consumer experience.

### Solution:
- Using Time Series Forecasting for Product Storage Management 
- This helps partners and communities to manage food requirements and donations for 5 days into the future so food wastage can be reduced.
